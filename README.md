# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech

This project was about building a smart thermostat system using a Raspberry Pi and different hardware parts like LEDs, buttons, an LCD screen, and a temperature/humidity sensor. The main problem it solved was creating a way to control heating and cooling based on temperature readings, while also letting the user interact with the system through buttons and a display. It helped show how hardware and software can work together to solve real-world problems.

One thing I did particularly well was organizing the code using a state machine. This made it easier to understand what the system was doing at each step, like switching between heating, cooling, and standby. It also helped me avoid repeating code and made testing easier.

I could improve the project by adding better error handling and making the system respond faster to temperature changes. Also, I think I could spend more time cleaning up the comments and maybe adding more user-friendly messages on the LCD display.

Some tools Iâ€™ve added to my support network include Python libraries for GPIO control, tutorials on Raspberry Pi projects, and forums like Stack Overflow for help when I get stuck. I also relied on my notes from class and lab guides to stay on track.

The most transferable skills from this project are working with hardware components, writing Python code in a structured way, and understanding how embedded systems work. These skills will help in future classes and real-world projects that involve coding and electronics.

To make the project maintainable and readable, I used clear function names, added comments to explain what each part of the code does, and kept the logic organized using a state machine. This makes it easier for someone else (or future me) to understand and update the project later.
